[TOC]

This was a follow-up assignment to the previous one I completed using python to follow the below specs.

Meals Choice is a program designed to collect patients ids and the dietary requirements for each patient. This information is then checked against a set of available diets and the diet that has the lowest absolute difference between protein, fat and carbohydrates is returned. This information is then saved in a csv file with the patient id and diet.

## Prerequisites

Please ensure before running this program that you meet the following requirements:

* You're running the latest version of Python3
* You're using a Linux or Mac OS machine. Currently unsupported on Windows.
